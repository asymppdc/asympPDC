% **Description**:
% This is a toy model example that "mimicks local field potential
% measurements along hippocampal structures, is represented by the
% following set of linear difference equations with N = 7 structures",

% feedback from

%% Equation Model I with feedback
%
% <<fig_baccala2001b_eq.png>>
%
% *Note*: "These equations are designed so that $x_{1}(n)$ behaves as an
% oscillator driving the other structures, either directly or indirectly,
% according to the diagram above. Note that the interaction between
% $x_1{(n)}$ and $x_3(n)$ is both via a direct path and via an indirect
% route through $x_2(n)$. The dynamics of the pair $x_4(n)$ and $x_5(n)$ is
% designed so that they jointly represent an oscillator, whose intrinsic
% characteristics are due to their mutual signal feedback but which are
% entrained to the rest of the structure via $x_3(n)$. To this structure it
% was added  a feedback from $x_5(n)$ to $x_1(n)$, which establishes a loop
% among structures 1 to 5. The signals $x_6(n)$ and $x_7(n)$ belong to a
% totally separate substructure where $x_6(n)$ is designed to generate
% oscillations at the same frequency as $x_1(n)$; $x_7(n)$ does not
% feedback anywhere." (Reproduzed and modified from Baccala & Sameshima, 2001b)

% *Notes*: The spectral coherences are plotted in gray-line. You may notice
% that although the isolated structures 6 and 7 have power peak at the same
% frequency of remaining structures, they will most likely be present with low or
% no coherence with other structures. The red-lines indicate statistically
% significant PDC. You may also see occasional spurious false-positive
% connectivity detection, which may occur in approximately equal probability to the
% level of significance chosen for the null hypothesis for non-causality
% test, i.e. $\alpha$.

% * In the original article the amplitude of |PDC| or |DTF| was plotted. Here we
% chose to depict squared |gPDC| and |DC|, i.e. the xplot.m function was designed to only
% handle squared magnitude measures, $|PDC|^2$, $|DTF|^2$ --- as the
% asymptotic statistics were formulated for these measures ---, and
% $|Coh|^2$ the spectral coherence.
