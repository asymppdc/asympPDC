%% 
% *Remarks on nonstandardized unbalanced noise analysis*:
% 
% * Note that in this example the time series were not standardized.
% * As a consequence, due to the high variance/power of channels
%   $x_1$ and $x_3$, $|{PDC}(\lambda)|^2$ from other channels reaching these channels are 
%   high, but
%   still in most cases not significant (represented by green lines).
% * The Patnaik thresholds plotted in dashed-lines may not be visible in these 
%   subplots because their values are well above  upper limit of scale 
%   range which is limited to [0 1] on y-axis.
%   


%% PDC p-values plot
%

[hp,hxlabel,hylabel] = xplot_pvalues(strID, c, ...
                               flgPrinting,fs,w_max,chLabels,flgColor,flgScale);
xplot_title(alpha,metric,'p-value PDC',strTitle);


%%
% *Remarks on PDC p-values plots*:
% 
% * Obviously this will vary with the simulations, As we are dealing with 7
% channels, there are 42 combinations of pair of channels. For random
% Gaussian processes, most likely one will see occasional false-positive
% inference in a rate proportional to the chosen alpha, which is 5% in this
% example. So one would expect roughly 42*0.05 false-positive cases in each
% simulation.
% * One can see above each subplot the Granger causality test p-value
% printed in green (not significant) or purple with dot (significant GCT)
% that should agree or be approximately equal in magnitude in most cases
% with the PDC p-values (our experience) plotted in frequency domain.


%% Information PDC estimation and analysis parameters
% 
% If the metric is either 'diag' or 'info', the unbalanced noises are 
% ruled out or scaled in their formulation as you can see in 
% the information PDC calculation results shown
% bellow. Same consideration would apply for information PDC.
%
% Information PDC analysis results are saved in *d* struct variable.

metric = 'info'; % info = information PDC (iPDC) or iDTF.
nFreqs = 128;   % Number of frequency points to consider
d = asymp_pdc(u,A,pf,nFreqs,metric,alpha);
d.Tragct = Tr_gct;
d.pvaluesgct = pValue_gct;

%% Information PDC plot
%
flgColor = 1;
[h,hxlabel,hylabel] = xplot(strID, d, ...
                               flgPrinting,fs,w_max,chLabels,flgColor,flgScale,flgMax,flgSignifColor);
xplot_title(alpha,metric,'PDC',strTitle);

%% Remarks on false-positive connectivity detection ratio:
% 
% * As 42 combinations of *PDC* and *GC* are tested, chances are that you
%     will see significant $|{PDC}(\lambda)|^2$ (red lines), also in the
%     case of $|{PDC}(\lambda)|^2$ (see above), in some plottings. The
%     significant *PDC* probability depends on significance level you have
%     chosen for null hypothesis PDC testing.
% * As stated before, the false-positive rate is approximately equal to the
%   chosen level of significance $\alpha$ value.
% * The similar argument would apply for "instantaneous Granger causality"
%   outcomes evaluation, and the combination of 21 pairs of variables
%   should be considered as *iGC* is a symmetric relation in this case.
%


%% General remarks about xplot features:
%
% * When `flgColor=1` parameter option is used in the xplot.m routine, the
% y-axis intervals: (a) [0 .01] background is colored in *LIGHT-PURPLE*; (b) (.01 .1] in
% *LIGHT-BLUE*; and (c) (.1 1] is *WHITE*.
%
% * If the y-axis is scaled according to the maximum amplitude of the measures, 
% this color coding may help easily getting clue about the magnitude 
% $|{DTF}|^2$ or $|{PDC}|^2$ estimates.
%
% * If the background is *LIGHT-PURPLE*  one would know the maximum amplitude is
% smaller than 1/100, while with *LIGHT-BLUE* background is smaller than 1/10.
