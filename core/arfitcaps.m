%% ARFITCAPS 
%        Capsule function to call the arfit.m routine, part of 
%        "ARfit: Multivariate Autoregressive Model Fitting" package.
%
%% Syntax:
%      [pf,A,ef] = ARFITCAPS(u,IP)
%
%% Input Arguments
%   u:          time series
%   IP:         VAR model order
%
%% Output Arguments 
%   pf:         covariance matrix provided by ARFIT routine
%   A:          AR estimate matrix provided by ARFIT routine
%   ef:         forward residuals provided by ARRES routine
%
%% Description:
% ARFITCAPS is capsule that calls arfit.m and arres.m routines, part of 
% Autoregressive Model Fitting" package, which implements algorithms 
% as described in the following articles:
%
%    [1] Neumaier A & Schneider T, 2001. Estimation of parameters and
%         eigenmodes of multivariate autoregressive models. ACM Trans Math
%         Softw, 27:27-57.
%    [2] Schneider T & Neumaier A, 2001. Algorithm 808: ARfit - A Matlab
%        package for the estimation of parameters and eigenmodes of multivariate
%        autoregressive models. ACM Trans Math Softw, 27:58-65. 
%
%  If you are interested in using ARfit algorithm for VAR model estimation, we
%  advise you to get the software from Tapio Schneider's website at
%                 https://climate-dynamics.org/software/#arfit
%  or from Mathworks.com File Exchange site (verified on August 27, 2021, but
%  not tested)
%        https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/174-arfit,
%

%
%%  Note: As described by the authors, acf.m in ARfit needs Signal Processing 
%  Toolbox (TM), as it requires XCORR, a cross-correlation function estimator.
%
%  ARfit availability was checked on August 13, 2015, and August 27, 2021. KS
%
%  The version we have tested and included was obtained on February 24, 2011 from
%       www.gps.caltech.edu/~tapio/arfit/index.html, 
%  which is now obsolete.
