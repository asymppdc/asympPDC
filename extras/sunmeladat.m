% Description
%
%  "This data is from skin.dat Data File in Andrews and Herzberg (1985).
%   The aetiology of melanoma is complex and may include the influences 
%   of trauma, heredity and hormonal activity. In particular, exposure 
%   to solar radiation may be involved in the pathogenesis of melanoma. 
%   Melanoma is more common in fair-skinned individuals and most frequent 
%   in skin sites exposed to the sun. In white populations melanoma is 
%   more common in areas closer to the equator where the intensity of 
%   solar radiation is higher. Data from various parts of the world suggest 
%   that the incidence of melanoma is increasing. The data below, giving 
%   age-adjusted melanoma incidence, are from the Connecticut Tumor Registry 
%   from 1936-1972. Connecticut has the longest record of state 
%   population-based cancer statistics in the United States of America. 
%   The data also includes the sunspot relative number. Houghton, Munster 
%   and Viola (1978) have shown that the age-adjusted incidence rate for 
%   malignant melanoma in the state of Connecticut has risen since 1935 and 
%   that superimposed on the rise are 3-5 year periods in which the rise 
%   in the rate of incidence is excessive. These periods have a cycle of 
%   8-11 years and follow times of maximum sunspot activity. The relationship 
%   between solar cycles and melanoma supports the hypothesis that melanoma 
%   is related to sun exposure and provides evidence that solar radiation 
%   may trigger the development of clinically apparent melanoma. The columns 
%   are the year, male incidence, total incidence, and sunspot relative 
%   index. The incidence are rates per 100,000." (Andrews & Herzberg, 1985)
